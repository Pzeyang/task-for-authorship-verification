He turns a bit, and our eyes meet directly. I can\"t describe it...in this next moment, I don\"t look away, how awkward it seems. I stare into his eyes. They\"re like Hoole\"s... They are Barn Owl eyes, but Hoole\"s eyes. They\"re his eyes...Hoole\"s eyes...', 'They hold that light of valor, justice, that one glow that I always made me feel my gizzard twitch in the bottom of my heart. Hoole... He never wanted me, did he? He loved me, but only who I was pretending to be. He never loved me, only Emerilla...lucky owl. I just wanted to belong -- because I was nothing -- and he gave me that. He was so fair, so kind...he gave me something even Kreeth could not. Mum and Da -- Ygryk and Pleek -- were supposed to be my parents. I was supposed to be their chick, Lutta.', 'Yet they left me. They talked about me behind my back...I was a freak. My own parents loathed me. Oh, they tried, but they left in the end. They didn\"t love me. Kreeth used me. No one really loved me, or even looked at me normally. All I was was a freak, nothing at all. Then he came along. Him, Hoole. The only one who let me belong, looked at me with kindness in his gaze, not looking like I was a...monster... Why was I born? Not one person cared about me.', 'I was just freak my parents didn\"t want, a weapon for auntie\"s uses, and a fake to my only love. He cared, but didn\"t know me. In the end, I was a monster to him too. Now I\"m back. And now I wonder... I suddenly stiffen as I think up to a thought. \"What happened?\" I shoot up and stare into those kind eyes. I trust him to answer. \"Please, who are you? Where am I? Where\"s...Where\"s\"--I choke up, but the question is already on my tongue--\"Hoole?\" My talons clench as the name leaves me.', 'At once, I see sympathy clearly written over their faces. A pang enters my heart. Sympathy for me? A nothing? \"Lutta.\" Sweet words again, and I suddenly wonder how this Barn Owl knows my name. \"It\"s hard to explain, but please...\" \"Listen carefully.\" Everyone, including me, jumps as the Great Gray speaks -- in a rather booming voice -- for the first time. The Elf Owl frowns at him. The older Barn Owl gives him a quick nudge. Words tumble from the young Barn Owl\"s beak.', '\"Lutta, we read about you in legends. It\"s been a long time since you were... \"Well, you\"re at the Great Ga\"Hoole Tree, and it\"s been a long time since you were...\" His voice dies down as he hesitates. \"Dead,\" the older Barn Owl finishes. He says it with that sympathy shown in his eyes. \"It\"s been thousands of years from your time, and we read about you from some legends about some...events...\" He clears his throat, determined to go on. \"Coryn here\"--a gesture at the young Barn Owl--\"is the king.', 'I\"m his uncle, Soren. This is Gylfie\"--a gesture at the Elf Owl, who nods in greeting--\"Twilight,\" the Great Gray, \"and Digger\"--what a funny looking Burrowing Owl. \"My uncle and his friends are called the Band,\" Coryn adds. I let this newfound information seep in. Thousands of years? Could this be possible? I was dead, right? It\"s been so long -- and...I was dead? How...? \"I have a GIZZARD!\" \"You do not have a gizzard, you fool! you idiot! I created you.', '\" \"You created me, but I created this gizzard!\" \"No!\" What is this? \"Emerilla?\" He turns as I change. He knows now...what am I to do? Dismay spreads through my body. He\"ll probably think I\"m a freak too, and he\"ll hate me. But I love him! In the next second, I\"m flying at him. Adrenline floods me as I feel...am I losing myself? This gref... He\"ll hate me now. I slam into him, and he flies backward. \"I love you!\" I want to scream. I want to scream those three words. To let him understand.', 'I want to scream, \"I love you!\" Then, an enexpected blow to the back of my head. Pain. Unexpected pain. Then talons, stopping me in my tracks. Talons...digging into me, slashing everywhere. My vision spins to red. I\"m being ripped apart at the seams. Torn. No... Why are you...? I sink, and I fall apart, literally. My feathers fall off, as my body becomes a lump of darkness. A lump of feathers. I truly am nothing... You\"d expect a real body when one is torn by claws -- and yet...feathers only.', 'My phantom gizzard lurches. \"Half-hags!\" \"I had to kill her.\" WHY? \"She pretended to be my Emerilla.\" Is that all! I\"m going to die like this! Just because I was an imposter! \"I knew from the start that something was not right about her. A blood deception she was -- a hagsfiend.\" Anger -- hot, seeping rage enters me. And cold feelings. Feeling that make me want to shed tears. \"No!\" I manage. \"Who are you?\" Who? Hoole...you accept me as someone? Hoole... \"I am nothing...and yet, I loved...\" I loved...', '\"Lutta?\" \"Hey! Are you all right?\" \"What\"s wrong? Lutta!\" I sink down as my mind spins. Then, I black out. All was dark except for the fluttering movement of wings -- brown wings. A Barn Owl shifted in the branches of the magnificent tree, her dark eyes gleaming as she looked into the hollow. How strange that she could get so close to the tree so easily. She was but a sillhouette against the branched skies. She eyed the hollow, and the inhabitants. Her son...too bad she would have to kill him.', 'He would have made a fine pure owl, had he not inherited his uncle\"s stupid softness. She could just kill him, right there and then. How easy, that everything she had been working for for the last few months would just be completed now, so easily. She could easily snatch the ember, then swoop in and kill Coryn, his disgraceful uncle, and get her dear mate\"s -- rest his soul -- revenge.', 'Then, kill those pathetic owls that were always around Soren, and anyone else she comes across in the tree, just for a bonus. It would be wonderful to see their pained, stupefied faces as she sank her claws through their feathers, one by one. Then she saw the hagsfiend, and her eyes widened in horror. I am the last! How is this possible? Why is she in that hollow! She could just kill her as well -- but her eyes caught something, and her gizzard twitched. No...she\"ll just stay back and observe.', 'This hagsfiend could prove some use to her and... Sadistic impulse shot through Nyra\"s gizzard. The adoring gleam in the hagsfiend\"s eye as she stared at Nyroc. No, she\"ll wait. Nyra silently spread her wings and swooped into the night sky. She had plotting to do. PT: Please, enjoy :) I hope I can fill up some holes in the story as soon as I can. Though, they\"re there for suspense.', 'Please review! Nothing, Yet A Love Never Dying PT: THANKS SO MUCH FOR READING, EVERYONE!! Enjoy! I have a little more to say: I know the last book already came out, and I\"ve finished it already.

Stop slapping me with your wing, it stings. Slap. Slap. \"WAKE UP, Lutta.\" Slap. Slap. Stop it! I\"m trying to-- \"Lutta, please!\" ...', 'Hoole? Hoole\"s voice! I flick my eyelids open -- all four of them -- at the same time. Hoole? No, it\"s Coryn. Just Coryn. \"Lutta, are you all right?\" The way he looks at me...it\"s like Hoole. So much like Hoole. \"I\"m fine,\" I answer, and immediately scan my surroundings. Perhaps I have become overly paranoid with time, but I can\"t be sure. In any case, I can\"t let my guard down in this case; I could find myself dead in a second, just like that I died in an instant -- killed by Strix Strumajen.', 'I shudder, remembering the memory of being ripped. Ripping, ripping, tearing, blood, pain-- Death. And then... Well, I don\"t want to think about what I don\"t remember. After that, there was nothing but a cluster of memories of what happened within death-- Falling. Falling... Floating...unraveling...flowing through the winds...becoming one with nature...then falling.... Falling, falling downwards, a curse uttered upon my kind: \"To hagsmire.', '\" Hagsmire, where the ones who have sinned within their lives went, for eternal damnation. Hagsmire, for hagsfiends, and...and... Nothings. Nothings -- they who mean nothing to the world, who should never have entered this life, this realm of breathing. Falling, agony, curses, darkness, cold hate. Those flaws of what life and death decide. And nothings. Nothings, like me. Nothing. Snap out of it. I don\"t want to remember. Of being one of the damned. And now I\"m back. Why? \"Lutta?\" -- and I look up.', 'Hoole -- no, Coryn. Coryn, the Barn Owl. Unconsciously, I stare at him with huge eyes that deserve to pop out of their sockets. \"Yes?\" I say. Oh Coryn, please don\"t look at me like that. You look like Hoole, please, don\"t look sympathic...please don\"t...I want it but you don\"t have to give it. Can you not see that my heart has already been broken? \"Lutta,\" he says, softly, and gives me a tender nudge with his wing. \"Can you stand?\" I nod, because I cannot find myself shaking my head. \"Yes.', '\" Can my legs work? He steps back slightly, to give me room, and I try to remember how to use legs again. Now, I just...position them...and push upwards... A searing pain. My legs! They hurt! They hurt! Fall down again -- No, I can\"t. I can\"t fall; I\"ve told Coryn that I will stand, will be able, and I will not lie; not anymore; I have already lied and tricked Hoole, I will not do so again, not to any owl. Nor this owl. This owl, who stares with the eyes of a true king.', 'A young king, but a wise one, and a good one. With difficulty, I stagger forward, out of the small nest. I feel the bark underneath my claws as I step on it; bark again, how it brings back thoughts of those days. It feels a bit unfamiliar, but I cannot forget bark. Such a thing is pathetic. I feel my legs quivering, wanting to give way, but no. No. I have said that I will stand. How they quiver! -- stop it.', 'Stop quivering! I have said I will walk, and I will walk, even if this pain continues -- like fire searing at me, numbing in a way. I will not lie again. Deception has torn me once before; never again. I look at Coryn, see the concern in his eyes; he hesitates to step forward, wanting to help. No, I can do it. Please. Let me. I walk, a little faster, wanting my legs to stride. They work, a little better. I look at Coryn again, and I ask, \"Where am I?\" \"The Great Ga\"Hoole Tree.\" Silence.', 'My breathe hitches quickly. \"The...\" I pause, mind spinning and reeling.

How, then...', 'how? -- how did a dead owl, undoubtedly gone for years upon years upon years...how could a dead owl rise, fresh and breathing, from the dead? This was illogical, and beyond the illogical itself. Of course there could be attempts to raise the dead, but...the body. And the sheer closeness to impossibility. Lutta, the owl of legend, was alive after being dead for so long. How...? Her body must have withered and become nothing but food for the earth to devour greedily.', 'Though the beyond of the horizon of the logical was boundless, this was still... How, he mused. How.

Was she an illusion? -- if so, she was something beyond illusion...she was too perfect to be something to be called a mere illusion. Coryn mused onward as he turned back to the sheafs of paper -- he had left Lutta for the pursuit of something...something that could shed its light upon the happenings. So long ago. Lutta.', 'Was this a work of nachtmagen? There was that possibility, faded as the yellow craft was. Then who had performed it? Coryn could not grab it; he snatched at empty air. There was nothing to tell him. Nothing that anything could tell him, nor aid him. This was an enigma beyond most anagrams of matters. This was a mess. He had found her, Lutta, merely lying on some branch of the tree. And, through some urging of the gizzard, he had brought her back into the tree itself. This made little sense.', 'He dived into another pool of thoughts. What if...? There was a bang; he jumped and turned. There was a curse of \"raccdrops!\" Twilight. Coryn called, one wing still laid flat over a book, \"What\"s going on?\" More cursing, followed by Gylfie\"s reprimands. There was a loud whirlwind of a flutter, and soon the whole Band was within the room! \"What?\" Coryn said loudly at the undignified relative of a heap before him. \"What\"s happened?\" Something shot through his gizzard.', 'Soren spoke first, in a rushed but determined voice. \"She\"s gone!\" Another shot. Something like cold fear and wonder. \"She\"s gone!\" Gylfie wailed. \"Lutta\"s gone!\"'], ['\"All will become one with Russia,\" he said, almost simply, his cheer eerie. Fists were already clenched; now they groped about, for a pan, a rifle, a sword-there was nothing. In some way, this brought her but a sigh of relief-Gilbert and Roderich, she was reminded, were not here to suffer as well. If Ivan put his giant hands on Roderich...', 'Click, went an object, and Elizaveta was snapped into the world when her own instincts pulled her head away; on time, for Ivan\"s collar was soon found to be touching the tip of her nose: she went cross-eyed staring at the thing: it pinched her skin, now red with anger. How dare you- Oppression! No one could lay that yoke above her again!-she would never allow it! Even when a sort of purple shroud seemed to wrap itself about Ivan and blaze as a fire would...', 'even as a faint eerie \"kolkolkol\" was thick in the air...Elizaveta held her ground-glaring, hating, repulsing. Oppression. No more oppression...! His eyes dropped; his hand followed: with a bolt of alarm-lechery?-feint?-Elizaveta took one step back, bristling as the wolf does.', 'Watching the muscles of the Russian arms twitch, she ducked when he snatched at where her waist would have been had she remained still; with a quick flush of indignation, she glared upward; if only Ludwig had not been forced out! He had retreated with such haste, back to Berlin, offering to bring her with him, though knowing that she would not leave-Hungary was her, and her place. So he had left, alone and resigned to the fact that even Veneziano had to leave him, taken by the Allies.', 'Elizaveta had watched him go with as much resignation. Endsieg, the Germans called it. Ivan was huge, behemoth above an ant...no, not an ant, but perhaps a lotus...perhaps a hybrid of that with a rose. There is no rose without thorns, after all. The Soviets had already been merciless, ruthless as the next army: the ache of rape and massacre fluttered about the land. If anything, the nation itself would fight. Useless as it was. Ivan dropped the collar.', 'Still galvanizing with mental shocks down the spine, she watched closely. Too closely. Ivan\"s hand dove downwards and snatched. With a horrified she jumped back, giving a swift right hook to his neck, the closest she could reach. -And in the end, it almost didn\"t matter. Ivan smiled triumphantly as a long-forgotten weight was shifted from her belt. With a savage look from one of him and Elizaveta, the paper was in between his fingers...', 'Elizaveta looked, stunned-in the moment it felt as if the appendix had been removed from her body. As useless yet familiar thing was there, the memory of its origins...filled with not blood, but gore-milk skin against the universe of deadness. The paper was scrolled about the Russian\"s fingers; somehow, it completed the image-a bloody Soviet, grinning wickedly as the royal purple billowed from his eyes: to top it all off, a dirty cream paper twisted about his raised digits. It was almost gray.', 'She had long since forgotten about the thing; the small text, written in Gilbert\"s-a frantic parry-handwriting; out fell a finger, and it was the one from the bombed wreck. Just its weight-it had been there all along, useless, a little keepsake of Berlin; what she had seen there. What she had left behind for her own Hungarian version. It was white still, yet shriveled, and dry-that was all; it had changed, though not enough. \"German,\" Ivan said, warmly-no, coldly...', 'swelteringly icy, and that was oxymoronic, but oxymoronic was practically the composure of him...him, all him. \"This is a finger from Germany, da?\" \"How do you...\" She sucked in a breath; refused to let her eyes widen. The grin widened; \"Just a lucky guess.\" He giggled, sickeningly, violet mist shrouding the remains of his person; his teeth were a white and perfect-they flashed in the buttercup sun, which laid its yellow upon the stiff white ground, touched with chill.', 'Elizaveta stood stock-still then: she did the whole time; something had been torn away, and it lay resting among Ivan\"s grubby fingers, clad in leather-worn leather gloves that anyone would wear these days...she rubbed at her own, slightly shredded, at the still-clothed fingertips. Hands-they were worn down: hers and Ivan\"s. Beaten flesh.', 'Looking up again, relief flashed briefly, the white light stark against her crimson crumbling heart, or else the mind-one was meaningful as the other; with that thought, of Roderich, Gilbert, Ludwig, Veneziano, and the war as a human, Ares... Endsieg. There was nothing to lose, but more lives. Eyeing the Russians, who had swept her land into scorched blood, she charged. There was nothing more to lose, and she kept on telling herself that.', 'Even as the Soviets rushed over, rustling the paper with the breeze stirred by their boots; even as she lay ready to die, ready to live, tired as a nation at the end of his time. There was plenty of dust, and plenty of blood, and her body ached. It fit-it all fit.', 'The yoke had been laid over her shoulders-the niggling thought that it was cracked brought no satisfaction: the Soviets still had claim laid over the land fought so hard for: Everything I\"ve done, she thought, as a cough formed within her throat, was for my people. Her thoughts flickered, at Roderich, at Gilbert-if she could not fight, she could marry, or give herself over; but she could fight, she merely needed the mentality rather than the plentiful physique: that was why she was in...this.', '\"Fuck,\" she breathed, eyes shut against the world. The last soldier soon disappeared through the limits of sound; peace and dust remained-not one stray man was left, no one else to strap the lead to her bones.', 'Limbs aching, heart aching, mind aching, she lay there among the debris- No wonder, then, said the idle mind; she could have scowled, but it would have hurt too much-coughing did not help: if it stayed, it hurt the throat; if it was released, it cut the throat; the effort of checking it racked the whole body, and there was none of it anyway. Head lolling back, Elizaveta felt the paper, the finger, lying dead on the ground: Russia had dropped it, mockingly, to replace the grave flowers.', 'There were no flowers, aside from those withered things in her hair. They were papery. Still, being near dead...the well of strength was dry. There was but moisture left in the moss growing upon the clammy stone-up the frozen cylinder it traveled, and so she flinched when the hand came. It was cold. Cold-and yet, hot as ice-white and freezing; the touch was familiar. It was light as a feather. The feather was upon the shoulder; it pressed, though not harshly; still, it could not be described as gentle.', 'The hand was frail as her strength-brittle and cold and old. She refused to open her eyes then. She had decided, some time ago, that she liked the dark. She preferred it; it was friendly, and it allowed ignorance to be an excuse. It was kind, and she wished it could be a closer friend. But white-why white... \"Hey,\" said something, someone, something, someone.', 'The ax scraped against the stone; it rasped with a familiar tinge of the past months, which were long as eternity, significant as the rest of time\"s children. It was a beautifully ugly voice, salty, bloody, white as fire. In the next moment there was nothing but one thing-it could not be. The pressure increased, it was beginning to hurt. Not able to growl, Elizaveta shifted with painful instinct-another cough ripped through her chest.', '\"Hey,\" said something again, and she summoned what was left of the moisture in the moss to flick her eyes open-it hurt: her eyes stung in white with water, but she knew it would come to pass. Everything comes to pass. Everything-absolutely everything: she had to keep on telling herself that, for though it passed, it took its very sweet time doing so; so that she could almost taste the bitter sparks on her tongue; it was parched, and thus drier. Spice. \"Fuck you,\" she whistled through her throat.', 'It stung. It could not be.', 'The pressure increased, not unexpectedly; it squeezed upon her shoulder, and it took a large muster of strength to finally blink the fluids away from the eyes, so that they were a clear green again-the first sight was white, as it always was-the second blink brought the sight of red, and some part of her-somewhere, deep down or hidden-despaired: agony nudged at her again, and she knew that those papers would not have been so kind as to let her go: no, she had to confront; it was a gift of something...', 'that would not irk her for the rest of eternity, and yet a curse of more pain. The choice of selfishness or selflessness, when both loosed their boundaries and came together. And that hurt. More than anything, that hurt-the scorch of disappointment; denial, anxiety, fear-there was too much of it. And yet, she did not want him dead. It had taken her time, so much time to realize that...', 'but she did not wish death upon anyone, having seen too much of it as the clock ticked away-she had never wanted anyone to truly die. Gilbert Beilschmidt, though she hated him above all, was no exception. But in times such as now, when war tore the world apart-when history decided to twist itself about-when the nations crumbled-how could death not be a blessing?-at this point she could almost want them all to be dead. Roderich, Gilbert, Veneziano, Ludwig...', 'and yet she would watch with relief on the day that each of them would pick themselves up, and charge into the distance with life. She hated war. She blinked rapidly, staring, always watching; though she ached, she let the next batter of coughing come to pass-shock, it overcame her then.', 'Charging upward, body screaming in protest, she could only slap him with strength that came by habit, before wrapping both arms around him, wondering how and why in hell- \"Get off me, woman!\" he protested, attempting to flail; she saw now that the tin had been stripped away, or at least most of it, as she felt him, flesh and cloth and hair-from the unhealthy pallor of his skin, from the dried hard uniform, to the pinked and browned hair, silver still shining boldly beneath the blood.', 'He was unusually warm-hot even-when she felt him; clearly the cold had been warded off, though his hands still felt like ice; remembering the documents found in Ludwig\"s office, she realized that it was fever. But his head-feeling about the neck, she knew it was there-desperately feeling, just to know how cruel death was, she felt it, finding no seam-with a thin cry of joy and pain she kissed it, squeezing him till he was strangled- \"You\"re alive,\" she breathed, even as garbled speech flew from his lips.', 'She was going into spasms-this was too unreal! And yet it was. He was so, so solid. His eyes were ruby. No petty pink glaze upon the Kingdom of Prussia\"s gaze-no death frosting them over. Clinging to him, something told her that she would never let go-a stupid little piece of wishful thought, no doubt: never let go, how ridiculous; and yet she did not release him, as he calmed between her limbs, resigning with guilty pleasure, rigid with denial.', 'She could not even loosen about him-there was nothing but the jail scene playing and replaying itself in her mind-letting their hands drop, parting, and then the sickening sound of the guillotine\"s strike. Water, red, pink, silver, white, black. The swastika rose over all, as if to mock... \"Where in Isten\"s name have you been?\" she muttered against his shoulder, before lifting her head away hastily; still, though, she did not let go; she wanted to savor it. As the vampire feasts on blood.', 'The scent of metal clung to him. \"Get off,\" was the obstinate reply; she lifted her hand and slapped him again, not knowing what else to do. \"Ow!\" \"Where\"ve you been?\" she said again. \"You were supposed to be dead-\" \"Well, I\"m so freaking not-\" \"I saw your head!\" she said, voice reaching a higher octave.', '\"It was a fake!\" \"Impossible,\" she declared, eyes widening before she finished; it came to her, suddenly-the way it had fallen, the sudden hush of death, the blindfold of stars, the blood-she had seen it, touched it, waded in the water it buried itself in.... She had suffered with him at death. \"You were dead...,\" she whispered; it gave way to coughing, and he only watched as she did; held onto her and she held onto him. \"I heard the thud. If you were dead-\" He grunted.', 'When she looked up, his eyes were a bitter red. \"The head was fake. They...held me down.\" Scowling, he looked away; admittance was ignominy. \"They held me down up there. There were lots of them, Hungary-scheiße, there was a lot of back-up that we didn\"t notice; I couldn\"t beat off all of them. And my gun ran out...\" His voice faded; still, his scowl deepened, and he finished to his own satisfaction. \"Their leader was fun to kill though.', '\" He laughed, cruelly, forcefully-he found no love for death, though he had seen enough of it to mind less. Elizaveta decided against shaking her head-it could only be true; she had known him for years, since they were incomplete nations, just children running about with swords of both wood and steel.', 'Just as he had sifted out her identity from that of Elisabeth Wertheim\"s, it was with ease that she found that this man in front of her was real: as nations in human form, they were allowed the same detached senses as those immortal. Stupid, she scolded herself, knowing not to trust so easily; but it was what it was. She noticed the shards of tin still upon his flesh then-of course, he could not have been thrown out so easily-time was needed, so much time; some things did not change, but could.', 'They trapped him. Shackled his person. Still not releasing-he was too real, too solid, to let go-she let the glimpses of his uniform and body form in her mind; she looked about, saw the blood, the bruises, the sickly pallor of his skin. Dread formed with it, in a way almost instinctive, be it Gilbert or not: \"What did they do to you.\" It was not a question-it was an exclamation, asking, wondering, but not questioning. The papers came to mind again. A pause-it was too long, in Elizaveta\"s mind.', 'With a ferociousness that came at will, that sapped her meager strength as well as supplied it, she asked, this time, demanded, \"What did they do to you?\" He was biting his lips, not speaking; still, obstinately, she took him by the shoulders again, harder, saying, \"What did they do to you?\" The papers came to mind again...how Ludwig had admitted it, how Gilbert had been so emotionless for the past year....', 'A protectiveness that she had never felt before, for but Roderich and Veneziano, but never this man, emerged; it reared its head menacingly-some maternal side of her glared outwards, and she shook him. \"Tell me!\" He only bit his lips harder. \"Tell me, God damn it,\" she said. \"I found documents in Ludwig\"s office. Is it true...\" he looked at her \"...that, throughout the war....\" \"Ja,\" he said, finally; his tone shook at the slightest, but was steely at the same time. His eyes grew hard.', 'Elizaveta had never seen him like this, before the war-so close to tiredness, so close to a sort of trauma; he spread trauma, he did not suffer from it. She had known him for so long, and yet finally.... Not noticing how hard she was holding onto him, as if to crush him, she leaned in with complete urgency, green pools of eyes reflecting the cracked image of Gilbert Beilschmidt. \"Russia...hurt my people. So much.\" He snorted softly, in disgust. \"And der Führer\"-derision-\"doesn\"t like me a lot.', '\" The line along his brows became harsh, harsher than they needed to be. \"My people aren\"t West\"s. They\"re different. And they don\"t like der fucking Führer. \"West didn\"t know; he only knew later, but they told him I was dead. He was pissed and everything; he lost my awesomeness after all.\" The grin curled along his chapped lips. There was no humor in it. \"I\"m just a small state now; I\"m the most freaking awesome state that existed, but I\"m still just a state.', '\"They experimented on me,\" he continued; Elizaveta could see the anger etched along his face, and she felt it too; she had suffered, though not as much, by the way it sounded-her Jews were still her people, no matter what the Germans said. She could never understand why others could do this to people.... \"Russia\"s people and West\"s people. They raped the women and killed the children.', '\" A shudder passed through him, in painful memory; again, Elizaveta noted his love as a nation for his people; Prussian, Crusader, Knight he may be, he still had people. \"Well, mostly Russia\"s. West\"s did too, but mostly they just did those experiments and sent them off to work.\" Another sour laugh. \"Hitler thought I wasn\"t really important later on-before that he just sat around glaring and all.', 'I had to go to jail several times-they said I was encouraging sedition against him, and that\"s when it happened.\" \"They...\" Elizaveta spoke at last. \"Torture,\" he said, nodding coolly. \"Later Hitler started doing it outright-he thought that I wasn\"t good enough, and didn\"t deserve his shithole of a Reich. What a failure,\" he added darkly. She scowled at him, alarmed, angered, bewildered; \"Why didn\"t you tell Ludwig?\" \"And what would he have done?\" he answered cuttingly.', '\"Kicked him off and told the Allies and Jews that he was sorry?-West\"s a stubborn arschloch, and he loves his Führer so much.\" \"Oh Gilbert...,\" was all she could say, and she could only blink aside from that. \"Was?\" he snapped, silver locks bouncing. \"Is this why...\" \"Ja. Haven\"t you noticed that this Gott-forsaken war is tearing the world apart?\" \"I have,\" she said quietly, not protesting; his statement was horribly obvious. \"I don\"t think it\"d be easy to miss.', '\" Now it was her turn to smile, so she did; it was bitter as his, and the worn grinning soldiers were twins. She sucked in a breath before wheezing at the slightest; the image shattered. \"And,\" he added, though almost hastily, \"I\"ve always wanted to know\"-she looked at him, albeit with some anxiety for the topic-\"what in hell do you see in Roderich?\" She should\"ve slapped him. She should\"ve pummeled him into the ground. She should\"ve left him then and there. She should\"ve. She could\"ve.', 'In the end she did not. She saw it coming. She knew it had to-it was bound to, heading her way; the circumstances catapulted them at her; the tension crackling in the air, like electricity powered it-I should have come sooner, but now...she had never been able to measure the distance from whence it came. Now it was laid before, and she wondered why this exchange had never occurred between them-they were too busy fighting. Hating each other.', 'And she still hated him, but they had enough now, to ceasefire for the moment. Enough of what, she could not say. Roderich. How could she tell him...as she stared wistfully at Gilbert\"s crimson eyes, some part of her wished that she had never met him, nor Roderich-if only one should be nothing to her, she would be happy; he would be happy-no tumbling love, no turmoil with the blood split between them.', 'If she had only grown up to be a boy after all; if only it would be when she was still the wild girl on the plains (not that she would ever miss Mongolia, Turkey, or having to carry a bow and arrows out with her from so young an age...), beating Roderich-Austria-back till he could not even move; even before Gilbert began to defend her land. But no.', 'In the end she had met someone so kind, someone who had given her love in a hate-filled life; someone who gave her a second glance, and more, not in hostility or for the sake of land-he was fortunate Austria, who valued peace. Perfection did not exist-but to Elizaveta, he was the closest to achieving it; never had anyone been so positively unreal. She loved him. She could trust him. Gilbert had been hell-sent. He had made fun of all the trials of her life-hurt Roderich...', 'was a barbarian who cared for none for himself; there was nothing but power, and all who even stumbled in his path were gleefully slaughtered.

If not loved, then cared for; in the end, he was proven to be human, if not a ruthless one.', 'In the end, however...they were both merely tired nations, one about to drop dead; it was painful to think of. Had she fallen in love with this man? This man...who was merely one step away from even raping Roderich-she had thought it so when he came back speaking of lost Silesia, though she had been quick in recalling the pious side of her Prussian foe-could she have fallen in love? It was not impossible to love two-and it was only now that she thought it, thought hard. Unthinkable! she snapped.', 'She proved herself wrong when she put their mouths together. \"Roderich is better than you,\" she hissed through their teeth; his lips were cold, pale, chapped; chapped and cold as hers.

I finally managed to climb to my feet, stumbling over to cling to Kian\"s arm, he glanced at me, his eyes assesing the damage, then he put his arm around my shoulders and helped support me. Principal Powers took one look at me and called for a healing student. I smiled with gratitude at the small, brown eyed girl who skipped along and healed my arm quickly.', '\"Right\" Principal Powers sighed, wiping an arm across her forehead as she took in the damage. \"Who caused the mosst of this?\" everyone glanced at Kian then looked away but the Principal noticed and turned her gaze to my best friend. \"Okay then, Miss Rider, Mr Peace, off tot he detention room, Kian Evens, come with me. You\"ll be sent home for the day\" she started to walk off and a feeling of pain and desolation crept over me. I shook my head in denial.', '\"He can\"t!\" I screamed suddenly \"he CAN\"T leave me!\" but the stupid woman had already walked off. I didn\"t even realise i had shouted out unitil I glanced around and found everyone staring at me with shock. I ignored them and turned to Kian, who was watching me with worry and sadness, \"Shh, you\"ll be okay\" he whispered soothingly to me. The sound of this vioice shook me with emotion, happiness, saddness, anger, fear, alarm. More that i can\"t even name. I shook my head, fast and hard.', '\"No, NO, please, please YOU CAN\"T!, don\"t leave me!\" I begged, my voice breaking. Ever since that day with Ciara, we hadn\"t been seperated at all, mostly becasue we refused and threw wild fits of rage and fear when we were apart. \"Sorry, Cass, i gotta go...\" he whispered, pain saturating his voice. I watched him walk away from me, glancing back. I didn\"t understand why he would let them take him away so eaisily.', 'Why would he not fight for us? I could feel the power building inside of me, fueled by my confusion and mounting terror. I didn\"t even realise that i was being pushed gentily into the detention room until Warren sat down with a loud sigh. That single sigh of defeat triggered the alarm inside of me. \"Kian!\" I screamed, falling to the floor in agony. I vagly understood that i was shouting his name over and over again.', 'Out of the corner of my eye i saw a distressed Warren hesitently rise from his chair as he watched me rock about on the floor. Confusion marring his face. \"Cassidy\" Came a voice. I ignored it. \"Cassidy!\" Warren\"s voice cut through my pain. I wanted to ignore him but something inside of me wouldn\"t let me so I pried my eyes open and glared at him. \"Bastard!\" I screamed, suddenly pushing up from my position on the floor and flying at him in a wild rage. \"It\"s YOUR fault!\" my rage was over whelming.', 'The anger I felt, the fear of being left alone \"You made him leave! You and your stupid fire!\" I ranted on and on and ON for ages, I tried to stop but my emotions were playing havoc with themselves. Eventually I was too tired to carry on and I sank down, not even caring that I was leaning against Warren, \"He left me\" I whispered miserably, my pale, bloodless face twisted into a sad, lonely frown.', '\"Oh, God, he left me\" Tears were streaming down my face; I couldn\"t even lift my eyes to look at Warren\"s face. \"What\"s she crying about?\" a deep voice from behind me asked, I could tell from the sound of the new comer\"s voice that he was smirking. \"Leave her alone, Lash, just back off\" Warren muttered, strangely trying to comfort me by pulling me to his chest. My hate for him was over come by my fear and the need to be held.', '\"No, seriously, I mean it, what\"s wrong with her?\" The guy, apparently called Lash asked again, this time sounding closer. \"And I mean it when I tell you to BACK OFF!\" Warren almost roared. I wondered why his arms were lighting up as he was so angry but I didn\"t even try to comment, I just let my head rest on Warren\"s warm chest, trying to make my breathing back to normal. Nope, wasn\"t going to happen, Kian would have been able to help me...', 'Just stray thought of him made me hyperventilate, my thoughts fled as I started crying all over again. \"I can\"t believe he left!\" I managed to gasp out. \"Who?\" Lash asked curiously, I vaguely heard him sit down beside of Warren and myself. I was also aware of the fact that Warren shifted me slightly away from Lash, moving me more into his lap. I don\"t even think that he noticed he did it, but if Lash\"s snicker was anything to tell by, I\"m sure at least he noticed.', 'Managing to get my breathing under control finally, I looked to the side to see who Lash was. A gasp almost tore its way free from my lips but I sealed them extra tight so it didn\"t escape. Lash smirked as he noticed me eyeing him like I\"d normally eye steak. My stupid hormonal teenage body was playing with me once more because I knew as soon as I saw him, like, though I\"d never tell ANYONE, it had with Warren, I wanted him, as in I wanted to kiss him.', 'There were in total, only three guys that it\"d ever happened with, one being Warren another being Lash and also Kian, though I\"m sure Ciara...here I struggled to even think her name...had never known. Thinking fo my best friend was ahrd especially when she had basically destroyed my life. I\"m not sure if I mentioned this before but Kian and I worked out the reason why she had done it, killed all those people and herself, I mean. She\"d been a Super. Her power had been Empathy and Telepathy.', 'She could feel and hear everything around her so eventually it all got too much, but because every single person always thought that they wanted to kill someone they hated, even though they didn\"t, Ciara had felt that, so because her love for Kian and me was too strong even if anyone had hated us, she didn\"t kill us, everyone else however...yeah, they died.', 'I wish all the time that Ciara had killed me as well, I know that Kian hates it when I think that ay so I never think it when I can help it, but there are those odd times, times when I can\"t help but want to die, to kill myself. But Kian always stops me; even the thought of him makes me think again, he\"d be alone with no one to talk to about the day that no one else witnessed.', 'With a sudden jolt as Lash pokes me, I realised they\"ve been talking for about five minutes, trying to get through to me, looking up into their impatient waiting faces I find my self ridiculously spewing out the story of my life, hating myself even as I say it. All the while trying to stop. Finally ending my story after watching their faces to from confused, to even more confused to horrified I added one last sentence. \"And now he\"s gone with...with the principal, and, and I...', 'I don\"t know if I can take it, he\"s never just, just walked away like that! Never!\" I sobbed. \"I thought he\"d at least try to fight to get to me, like he, like he normally does!\" I cover my face with my hands, only just noticing that Lash and Warren are both holding one of my hands. When I finally calm down again and look into their faces, can se how ashen they look, I regognis3e it from the looks on everyone\"s faces for weeks after the shooting incident.', '\"Oh\" Lash finally manages, his voice almost sounding forced form his throat. \"Oh\" he repeats about a minute later and I can\"t help the tiny smile that ghosts over my face for a second. They notice and look slightly more relived but not by much. \"You cannot tell anyone, you do understand that, don\"t you?\" I tell them solemnly, already knowing that Kian would be very angry with me because even I was angry with me, almost unbelievably so. I saw them both nod, quietly agreeing not to spill the beans.', 'I really didn\"t want to be on the other side of Kian\"s rage when he found out. he way things are at the moment, it could be either Kian/Cass. Warren/Cass or Lash/Cass. I have got an idea but its not perfect and has loads of flaws so the next chapter will take a while, review and give me more ideas to make it go faster. This is mega short and by mega short, I mean MEGA...its in Andre\"s point of view because I need to show that he\"s not heartless, he\"s not mean or whatever some on you MAY be thinking.', 'So don\"t flame me, gently criticise me, I\"m working on getting a beta so maybe it might get better in time. I\"d also like to thank all my reviewers for...well, for reviewing, I guess. And can I just say (at least one of you is thinking right at this moment. \"oh, here she goes again\" but really I need to say this.) I hate writing in boy\"s point of views; I never really do it so forgive me if this sucks.', 'Kian\"s POV I hated leaving her there on her own, the helpless look in her eyes almost tore me apart but I knew it was necessary. I\"d had a vision earlier that day about the future, it was the only one I\"d never told Cass about. Normally everything that passes my mind passes through hers minutes later. We\"re best friends and she\"s like my sister, which is why I had to dot his for her. She didn\"t know it as I walked away but the fight on my behalf was almost staged.', 'Sure, I was angry at Warren for hurting Cass, and believe me, I could really have ripped him apart for that but he\"s part of the whole bigger picture, so anyway, like I was saying, Cassidy didn\"t know it yet but she was going to tell our story to Warren and another guy (who I know is important but I don\"t know why yet), in detention. I was slightly angry but I already knew that it was my leaving her in that hall way that caused the vulnerability.', 'Nothing else would have made her talk so much in the space of one day, even when she talked regularly on a day to day basis, I don\"t think I\"ve ever seen her talk that fast without ever taking a break for more then a second. So by leaving her there I made sure that she made at least two new friends who would protect her in the future, especially with the vision that I had. I knew she would need all the help she could get. I also knew that either Warren or Lash would be possible romantic interest.', 'I didn\"t really like Cass that way anymore, though I did used to have a big crush on her. My feelings were more of a protection thing. It\"s simple really. She\"s my world. She\"s my everything. My sun and my moon. All my stars and my hope. I would do anything for her, including die. Which in the future, I know I might have to... Mwahahahaha...', 'Yeah so, maybe you didn\"t notice the implication of his vision but its there for you to see, at the moment that\"s what I might be planning cos I see no other way to take this but know that the future is not set in stone. Okay here\"s the last thing i\"ll be posting for a while and no, sorry, its not a chapter. reason? well because im off to the caravan for 10 days where i will be trying to write none stop the endings of some of the sories i have going.', 'Summery: A/N Yay, finally the next chapter! yes, its short but since this is next on the list i ahve to finish, this story will be updated soon i think. \"Cass,\" I turned around, after just exiting the detention chamber, to see Kian fast walking towards me, the look of sorrow and guilt strong on his face, Lash had already been let out, ten minuted before me and Warren who was also long gone, running to catch the detention bus before it left.', 'Since he lived in a total different section of town to me and Kian i had decided to fly down. I could only fly with my telekinisis when i was really really upset. Kian appearing meant that the upset rating didn\"t klnow what to do, Did it rise because of the anger of him abandoning me? Did it fall? After all, he was my security blanket. my hope and my life. It jumped around a little (in other words went sky high then rocketed back down again.) But eventually settled down enough for me to breathe better.', 'Throwing yourself at someone carrying seven thick books isn\"t a good idea. Period. Kian had two choices when i went bounding up. Keep the books but be knocked over, or drop the books, brace himself and catch being the hero he was, he dropped the books, earning a mean scowl form one of the teachers heading for the bus park. \"Kian, Kian, Kian,\" i whispered his name over and over again, just stadining there as he cradled me in his arms. \"S\"okay,\" he murmured, \"Its okay Cass,\" But it wasn\"t.', 'There was still the fact that Kian had left me. Alone and without an explanation.'], ['\"Look-\" Suddenyl Tru stumbled, her jhand coming up to her stomach, as if to guard it. Her mouth opening in shock as she stared down at the blood dripping to the floor from her jeans. \"No,\" She gasped, \"Oh, no, no, no!\" Then she collapsed.', 'Summery: A/N He heh he, left you with a bit of a cliffhanger last time, didn\"t i? \"Tru?\" Harrison gasped, lunging forward to craddle her in his arms as she slowly slid down the wall at her back until her but rested on the floor, she ended up with her head against his chest and her feet curled up against the widening bloody patch on her jeans and white T-shirt \"Tru!\" She didn\"t answer, clutching her abdomemn like it was a life raft and she was on a sinking ship. \"Harry...', '\" She whispered \"Oh, god!\" Her brown eyes rolled backwards as another wave of pain engulfed her senses. Her brother didn\"t know what to do. \"Davis!\" He screamed. To anyone not in that room, hearing that scream, they would ahve known immediently that something was wrong, the agony in his voice made the scream real. Tru had enough strenght within her to think that Harrison was the only guy she knew who could amek a scream cound manly.', 'Davis rushed through the doorway, pausing in shock at the sight in front of him. Tru covered in blood, eyes almost closed. Harrison, crying and holding onto his sister. \"Oh, my-\" He started but shook his head, reaching for the phone in his pocket and thanking whatever god was out there that Tru had convinced him to buy a wireless.', 'Harrison could hear, somewhere in the back of his head, that Davis was making the call but his heart was hurting so much and he daren\"t look away from the woman in his arms, as if she\"d dissapear the instant his eyes rested elsewhere. \"Harry,\" Tru whispered, voice weak, barely there, \"Harry, get Jack...get him...tell-\" A harsh whimper of pain struck her thraot and she paused to breathe.', '\"Tell him, Harry, tell him i\"m so sorry,\" she was begging, tears cascading down her slightly bronzed cheeks, washing away some of the eye liner she ahd been wearing. Jack. What did he have to do with anything? But Harrison was in no way going to question her hurt sister, even if she did sound like she\"d lost her head. Yeah its short. My mind is blocked and so this is what i ahve at the moment. Doesnt really help that im hopelessly in love with a guy who cant even remember my name.', 'Depression can really block the creative flow. Summery: A/N Eh, im sitting next to a complete nutter who is stunting my creative flow, dont blame me, blame him. He is Uzukami, if you like dodgy crap then he\"d the guy to see, mostly Naruto fanfics. I recomend the chip adventure. Even if you don\"t like Naruto, its still funny. Harrison took the phone from Davis before he entered the ambulence that had finally arrived. Davis raised a solitart brow but didn\"t comment, he knew the reason.', 'The phone number he dialed seemed to ahve been siered into his mind although he had never even entered the digits to a phone before. Or so he thought. Jack picked up on the seventh ring. Harrison had been afraid that Jack wouldn\"t have picked up because the number would have been familier to him. Confusion settled in his stomach for a simple second before the worry for his sister corrupted it into pure fear. \"What?\" He heard Jack mutter, sounding depressed and somehow lonely. \"Jack...', '\" Harrison murmered, his voice muted and muffled by tears. Instantly Jack\"s heart stuttered, he remembered the exact moment when Harrison had phoned him, before the rewind had occured. Tru had been dead then adn Harry\"s voice was the exact same as it had been. He didn\"t reply because Harrison had already started talking again. \"I think-\" A chocked sob enterupted him and Jack\"s heart constricted in fear \"Tru, she needs you man.', 'At the hospital, whatever general, could you-\" Taking a deep breath, Harrison asked the dreaded question, expecting a no from Death himself. \"Could you go to her?\" He paused at the silence \"Please?\" He was surprised with the answer he got back, slightly distorted by the phone. \"Yes.\" So that depression i talked about last update? Yeah still there but i\"m taking a reviewers advice.', 'so blah! Summery: A/N Okay, time may get missed up, pretend that she\"s four months gone, okay? And even if a DNA scan isn\"t possible at this time in the pregnancy, just pretend it it. Tru wasn\"t awake when Jack arrived at the hospital. She was barely breathing. Harrison had his head in his hands, resting his palm on his forehead. Jack took in the tear tracks running down his face and came to the conclusion that Tru wasn\"t okay.', '\"Harrison?\" Jack asked, standing in front of the distraught brother, hands in pockets. Harrison didn\"t look up, didn\"t acknowledge the fact that Jack had bothered to come. Jack doubted he\"d be breathing if it weren\"t absolutely necessary \"Harrison!\" Jack repeated with a little more force. Harrison looked up briefly and gave him a look so full of pain that Jack feared he was too late, until Harrison nodded towards the room window in front of them.', 'Jack carefully patted him once on the shoulder, hesitated and then headed towards the see through glass. \"They won\"t let me,\" Harrison suddenly spoke up, head back in hands \"See her, i mean. They say its too-too much, it would be too much for her if she wakes, because of the shock of...\" Harrison, by this time, was crying too hard to speak. \"The shock of what?\" Jack questioned, hands clenchi8ng into fists, hoping that Harry wouldn\"t say \"loss of the baby\". \"The pregnancy. She can\"t know.', 'She would have told me, right?\" Harry looked at Jack, \"RIGHT?\" Jack just stared at the broken man in front of him. Why was he so upset? As if Harrison Had read Jack\"s mind, he replyed. \"I mean, yes, i should be happy, yeah? Happy that she\"ll survive, the baby...the baby would be fine too...if it weren\"t for...she would have told me, right? Jack was too confused to do anyhting other then stare. Then everything changed. And JAck cursed god for DNA scans.', '\"How could you!\" Harry yelled, jumping up and shoving Jack into a wall \"Rape? Even i didn\"t think you possible of something that bad!\" What? Rape? Jack blinked. \"Harrison, if wasn\"t against her will,\" Jack stated, frowning. Harrison glared at him.', '\"At the moment, its my sister or the child you put in her!\" He growled \"You can have both, just understand she was scared\" \"No, you don\"t understand! The doctor-he said that if the baby survives Tru dies, Tru dies? The baby lives!\" Sigh Summery: A/N Yeah, last chapter didn\"t even let Jack see Trum so here\"s that. Jack didn\"t say anything other then shove Harrison away and hurry over to the window. He anxiously stared through the window, watching the beep of the moniter measuring Tru\"s heart.', 'It was strange. Jack had expected her to look weak, frail even but she looked normal, apart form the very pale skin. He had expected there to be bruises, even though the source of the pain wouldn\"t leave seeable marks. He\"d expected it to be like a TV program, something unreal, but happy in the end. The very fact that she looked almsot fine should have told him that what happened in TV wasn\"t real, things did not always turn out for the better.', 'Obviously Jakc didn\"t believe that the TV was always real, yes there were documenteries, not that he watched them, there was porn...yes he may have dabbled, but the things like The Bill or Casualty, back ground noise really, they had a way of seeping into your brain, making you hope, then curse when the hope turns rancid. Jack didn\"t react when Harrison clamped a hand down on his shoulder, he didn\"t react, becoming mroe like Harrison had been when Jack had first arrived.', 'When Harry lowered him onto a chair, just with the push of hand on skin, Jack finally reacted. Wanting to cry, to scream, to die. But Jack did none of these, instead, he sighed. \"What happened?\" Harrison asked, voice quiet, steely with the resolve to find out what had made Tru sleep with Death himself. Jack wanted to ask the same question, he needed to know what had gone wrong the Tru\"s body. With the baby, with everything. \"Okay...okay,\" \"Get on with it!\" Harrison snapped when Jack paused.', '\"Right,\" Jack muttered \"Okay, so we were at the same place. A nightclud kinda thing. I didn\"t expect to see her there, i guess she didn\"t expect me either. Flash Back. \"Tru?\" There, sitting on a bar stool and nursing a glass of strong smelling alcohol, sat miss better-than-thou Tru Davis. I couldn\"t stop staring as i realised how out of it she was. As drunk as...well, a very drunk person.', '\"Quack?\" Came the slurred voice of the good fairy \"Whasup?\" Snorting in disbelief i took the seat next to her, watching with delight as she tensed slgihtly and sobered up a little, or at least enough to glare at me through half closed eyes. I didn\"t respond, only watched as she signeled to the bartender for another drink. He poured one but only after shooting be a worried glance. Maybe worrying that one of his custemers could possibly get alcohol poisening. I shrugged and watched again as she downed it.', 'Then motioned for another. He rufused, like he should ahev done maybe, five or so drinks earlier. Tru didn\"t even noticed. Just kept sipping on air. After that i joined her, we were both drunk, thinking we were best friends and telling each other all our secrets. She confessed to me that she liked my bad boy attitude and had had a crush on me for ages. i really have no idea who amde the first move.', 'We were just suddenly back at my apartment, writhing- \"Hey! No,\" Harrison gagged \"Dude, just like, stop! I really don\"t need to go to that scary visual place!\" Laughing, Jack shook his head. he had forgottern about Harry even still being there, forgottern that Tru could be dying at that very moment in time. He\"d been so caught up in the feel of Tru\"s hands on him, her lips. Even the memory of it was enough to make him hard.', 'Suddenly there was a beep beep beep and both Harry and Jack whipped around to see nurses and doctors rushing into Tru\"s room. They pressed their faces up against the windows, watching as the doctor glanced at the nurse at his side, wincing ever so slightly in a way that made Jack want to puke and Harrison want to curl into a fetal position and cry. Two places i can go from here, either Tru dies and the baby lives, the baby dies and Tru lives.', 'Or my special choice, they both live and the next chapter is the last, or second to last. Vote Summery: A/N This is the last chapter. Hope you like it, tell me if a sequel would be apreciated. Tru lived. The baby lived. Everyone lived. (With the exception of Jack\"s fish, who sadly passed away whilst he was with Tru in hospital. Everything was hunky dorie, right? Yeah, apart from Tru\"s father. And Harrison. And Davis. And maybe a couple of other people. But it didn\"t matter. It really didn\"t.', 'For Jack and for Tru the two best days of their lives were only a week apart. Three month after Tru left the hospital, after spending a long time being tested, Tru gave birth to a baby girl. They called her Jasmine. Jasmine Harper after the wedding that came a week after. Jasmine was beautiful. Her eyes were the weirdest shade of violet, hence the name and her hair was brown, she was born with short hair, it grew fast within the first year. Dark and light, mixed shades, shiny and sleek.', 'She was healthy and her giggles were adorable. At one year old she could walk, at two she could talk almost perfectly. The first word she said was \"Cake\". Tru and Jack had actualy recoreded it because of the do-over day that happened when Tru\"s brother\"s girlfriend died. Other then the occaisonal threat from the dad-from-hell the small family were getting on well. That is, until Jasmine reached age fifteen. Thats when the trouble begun. Yeah, so...sequel, anyone? \"Oh,\" Davis whispered \"Oh, God.', '\" he staggard backwards, throwing his amrs out to prevent falling, not noticing as Jacob sadly patted his shoulder as a way of offering his sorrow and exited the room, throwing one last sad look at the young brown haired female laying there, pale and in blood stained clothes. \"Oh, Tru.\" Meanwhile, Harrison was staring at the body of his sister with horrified eyes.', 'His entire body was shaking and his brain seemed to stop proccessing any rational thoughts as he reached out his hand, carefully as if she\"d suddenly come to life. She didn\"t. Tears fell from his eyes, making there path down his cheeks, Harrison could faintly taste the salt on his dry lips, the small stinging feeling that was strangly comforting, strangly feeling good against the pain in his heart. Tru lay there, head tilted to one side, the bullet wound was directly above her heart.', 'Harrison let out a small whimper, placing his hand over his mouth to stop the scream that wanted to well up in his throat. His sister was dead. Laying right infront of him with a bullet wound in her chest. Murdured. Someone had murdured his loving, life-saving sister for whatever reason. A reason that was not good enough no matter which way he could look at it. Suddenly the silence broke, filled with the pain of Tru\"s brother and friend. \"Tru...Tru. No.', 'Wake up, damn it!\" He fell to his knees, crying out in pain and clutching his cold sister\"s hand with a cold, numb hope that she\"d clutch back. She didn\"t. Harrison stood abruptly, pulling the sheet futher down until he could see her jeans pocket, eyes straying back up to follow the pattern of blood that stained almost every inch of the top she was wearing. The buldge in her left pocket told him her cell phone hadn\"t been taken. He gently removed it and scrolled through her phone book.', 'His eyes kept flicking back to Tru\"s body like it was a magnet and his eyes were magnetic. Already hating himself for referring to her body as if it was an it. \"Harry, what are you doing?\" Davis asked quietly, glancing once at his companion but then returning his eyes to his dead best friend. A shiver running through his body as he once again saw the blood. \"Phoning Jack Harper\" Came the quiet, defient voice.', 'Davis opened his mouth to disagree, to tell him he was being an idiot, that Tru wouldn\"t want Jack there but then he realised exactly the reason for Jack Harper A.K.A Death to be there. Harrison wanted Tru to ask for Jack\"s help. Right, i know the chapters are mega short but they will get longer, this just feels liket he right way to end it, i\"m posingt the next chapter almost straight away anyhow.', 'Anyway, did you like it? C\"mon people! Give me feedback so i can make it better, more realistic or is it fine just the way it is? \"Jack Harper here\" Came Jack\"s voice down the line \"Tru? Why the hell are you calling me? Tru?\" He spoke her name again after no one answered. Harrison let out a sigh of relief \"Jack!\" he instantly knew that his voice sounded scratchy, horse and vaunrable but he wasn\"t even able to summon the ability to care. \"Harrison...is that you? Well, now i am intruiged.', '\" Jack smiled but it was a small one, tinted with confusion. For one, he didn\"t know why Harrison was using his sister\"s phone to call him. Secondly, Harrison sounded like someone had just killed his puppy. \"Jack, you need to get over here. Please?\" Harry begged, pleading even though in any other situation he would never have rang their enemy anyway. Jack blinked. \"Why-\" He started to ask but he was cut off. \"Get your arse down here right now!\" Harrison all but screamed \"And hurry!\" The line went dead.', 'Jack looked at the ohone for another second before placing it back into his jacket pocket. \"Huh.\" Jack placed his half eaten taco down on the table, wowndering about the confusing phone call, part of him knowing he\"d go down there no matter what he was doing, just for the sheer pleasure of seeing/tormenting/teasing Tru. Well, got nothing better to do.', 'He thought these words as a comfort to himself, to convince himself that he was going because he was bored, and not just to see Tru, as he payed and walked to the morgue. XXXXXTRUCALLINGXXXXX When Jack walked throught the doors, it was silent, there were no sounds, not even Tru\"s quiet talking or the slam of books, or the tap of keys. Harrison wasn\"t mouthing off, Davis wasn\"t contemplating the cause of a death and Tru wasn\"t...wasn\"t doing the things Tru normally did at work.', 'The first flickers of worry started to worm their way into his heart. \"Harrison?\" Jack called out \"Where ar-\" the words died in his throat as the scene in main the room greeted him. A body lay in the middle of a slab, covered head to toe in the normal plastic sheet. What wasn\"t normal, however, was the fact that Harrison and Davis were both red eyed, Harrison was still crying...and holding the corpse\"s hand.', 'When he saw that Jack had entered, Harry slowly stood up, carefully pulling the sheet back to reveal Tru\"s body, covered in blood. Jack almost felt his heart stop. \"Please,\" Harry started \"Please, help her?\" Every eye was on him, waiting for an answer. Jack opened his mouth to say it wasn\"t up to him, he needed to be asked, when Tru suddenly sat up, turned to face him and whispered those words. \"Save us, Jack.', '\" Instantly he was transported back in time, thrown into the vortex and weird stomach feelings that always came with a rewind. Only this time it was different. This time he knew he would save her. Had to save her. Would die to save her. Sitting up in his bed as if he\"d been shocked, he did a quick memory check, wondering if Tru would remember being killed and if it\"d be worth asking her. He paused for just a second, realising with a small smile that he was glad Tru had asked him.', 'Whether it was because she trusted him or she got another chance, he was glad. Very, very glad. Thinking about Tru made him think of the words she ahd used to ask his help. Not save me, not help me. Save us Jack, thats what she had said. But did that mean \"Us\" her and another? Or...\"Us\" Her and Jack? Following Tru wasn\"t the hard part. For a smart, sharp-minded girl, she was surprisingly un observent. The hard part was keeping up with her. She was really fast when she wanted to be.', 'Pursing his lips, Jack ducked behind a Jack couldn\"t stop worrying about how she was going to get shot and where.', 'Would it happen in the girl\"s toilets, where he would only here the bang? Would it happen out in the open? Somewhere with innocent people? Worry clouded his brain as he realised Tru wasn\"t in his line of sight anymore, he stood, glancing around the peer for five minutes before he became aware of someone standing behind him but befoer he could turn, that same someone tapped him on the shoulder. Turning around, Jack was surprised to see that it was Tru behind him, looking pissed off and cute as ever.', '\"Tru,\" He started, smiling innocently, \"How nice to see you, weird how we\"re both here at the same time, huh?\" \"Yeah, weird, same time, total coincedence, right?\" Tru raised her eye brow in the normal way for her, and Jack was slightly distracted by the way her mouth looked when she was doubting something. \"Jack? Still in there?\" Tru waved her hand infront of Jack\"s eyes, aware that he was staring at her lips. \"Hmm? Oh, yeah.', 'So what brings you here?\" He asked casually with the smirk that annoyed her yet weirdly made her want to kiss him, plastered over his face. \"Like you don\"t know,\" Tru shook her brown haired head, \"Look, I know we aren\"t the best of friends...or really friends at all, I mean i know we...I reaslise that when we...\" she trailed off, unable to put it into words.

Blushing, Tru looked away. \"Yeah,\" She said quietly, \"Can you kepp that quite please? And i need to talk to you.\" She wasn\"t looking at him, whether she daren\"t or just didn\"t want to Jack didn\"t care, all he cared about was that Tru didn\"t want to, wouldn\"t even try, to acknoledge the fact that she had slept with him.', '\"Sure,\" Jack sighed, \"About what?\" \"Um, can we go somewhere private,\" But as soon as Tru had let the words come out of her mouth a look of unease spread across her face. \"Then again, here\"s fine.\" Jack chuckled. shaking his head slightly and following Tru into a slightly less populated part of the peer but still in a place people could see if anything happened. \"Look, i know its your job to kill people...\"Seeing the look on Jack\"s face, Tru rephrased her words, \"Or at least make sure they stay dead but...', '\"She hesitated and Jack chose that moment to jump in. \"You died yesterday, asked me for help, or actualy, you said to me \"Save us, Jack\" and so i intend to, just as soon as i know who the \"Us\" part is.\" Jack shot the words out of his mouth like they were hot bullets, anxious to make sure she knew he wouldn\"t hurt her, wouldn\"t stand by and let her die. Tru stared at him for a moment, blinking.', 'She had known that she died and when she noticed Jack following her, she had been so certain that he was on his way to make sure she died. There was truth in his words but Tru still didn\"t know whether or not to trust him because her head and heart were at war.'], 1, '0a37fcd9-80ce-5817-b2d8-2e8a1f9db1db', '1', ['1613564', '1613564'])\n"
